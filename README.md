## Overview of RAG Chatbot Operation
A chatbot using the RAG framework operates in two primary phases: 
 1. Retrieval phase
 2. Generation phase
    
### Retrieval Phase:
    
    1. User Query:        
    When a user submits a query, the chatbot first processes the text to understand the user's intent.
    2. Document Retrieval: 
    The system then searches a database or knowledge base for relevant documents or pieces of information that match the query's intent.                                This is done using a vector similarity search where the query and documents are embedded in a high-dimensional space, and the closest                               matches are retrieved.

    3. Candidate Generation: 
    From the retrieved documents, the system extracts candidate answers or pieces of information that could potentially be part of the final response.

### Generation Phase:
    1. Contextual Understanding: 
    The chatbot uses the retrieved documents to understand the context of the user's query better. This step is crucial for generating a coherent and relevant    
    response.

    2. Response Generation: 
    Leveraging a language generation model, the chatbot synthesizes the information from the retrieved documents to create a response. The model considers the    
    content of the user's query and the retrieved documents to ensure the response is contextually appropriate.

### Example Scenario

Imagine a user asks the chatbot, "What is the fuel efficiency of a 2020 Toyota Corolla?" Here's how the RAG framework would handle this:

The user's query is input into the chatbot.
The chatbot retrieves articles, databases, or other documents containing information about Toyota Corollas, specifically the 2020 model and its fuel efficiency.
The system generates candidate responses such as different fuel efficiency metrics or related information about the vehicle.
Using the context provided by the retrieved documents, the chatbot generates a response like, "The 2020 Toyota Corolla has an EPA-estimated fuel efficiency of 30 mpg city and 38 mpg highway."
The chatbot presents this response to the user, and depending on the user's reaction or follow-up questions, it may adjust the response or provide additional information.
By combining retrieval with generation, the RAG framework creates a chatbot capable of providing informative, accurate, and contextually relevant responses to a wide range of queries. The model's ability to retrieve relevant documents ensures that it can handle queries on topics that were not covered explicitly in its training data, making it particularly powerful for knowledge-intensive tasks.
